# Steps for working with a new data set

## 1. Make sure files are in directory the code is referencing

## 2. Examine file
* str()
* summary()

## 3. Decide on process

## 4. Examine formulas separate from function to make sure they work the way anticipated and if not, figure out how to make them do what is desired.

## 5. Check at every line of code to make sure to make sure it is doing what is wanted....Just because it runs does not mean it is running the intended way.
