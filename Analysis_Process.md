# Steps for working with a new data set

# 1. Make sure files are in directory the code is referencing

# 2. Examine file
### - str()
### - summary()
### - object.size()
### - making scatter plots using plot() can help.

# 3. Decide on process

# 4. Examine formulas separate from function to make sure they work the way anticipated and if not, figure out how to make them do what is desired.

# 5. Check at every line of code to make sure to make sure it is doing what is wanted....Just because it runs does not mean it is running the intended way.



#6. See if it can be optimized.
